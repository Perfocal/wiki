## Sharing

This feature allows customers to share their gallery (**in full**) to their friends or to social media - Facebook and Twitter as well as email.
Unlike the proposed idea for gallery sharing, we found that there wasn't a need for customers to be able to select which photos they wanted to share due to the fact that some galleries may have hundreds of photos which will be a hassle for the user to go through and select, or unselect, which photos they want to share. This means that the whole sharing process has been simplified and streamlined to allow the customer to share their gallery faster and with more ease.

The private gallery now includes a **'Share'** button which opens up a modal with four sharing options; **'Email'** **'Facebook'**, **'Twitter'** and **'Copy'**. Clicking on 'Facebook' launches a pop-up window which shows the standard Facebook sharing screen.

**Note: Because of the fact that the development sites are restricted to a local machine and server, `og` `meta` tags have not been tested but have been confirmed to be injected into the HTML.**

Clicking on 'Email' launches the default email application for the user's device.

Clicking on 'Copy' copies the link to your clipboard automatically and informs the user that it has been copied successfully. However, the user may wish to highlight and copy the link themselves which is also possible as the generated link is displayed along side the other options.

 There are also two new URLs as part of this feature. `https://perfoc.al/g/[random string]` and `https://g.perfocal.com/[random string]/p`. The `perfoc.al` domain is used purely for sharing purposes as it is short but not easily guessed due to the random string at the end, the user is then redirect to the `g.perfocal.com` domain which is used as the main display for the **public** gallery and has **no download or further sharing features**. This means that this is a purely public domain that other people can access, as long as they know the URL.

The random string is generated by making a 10 character string of `a-zA-Z0-9` giving `(26+26+10)^10 = 8.39299366e17` combinations. This string then does not have to be changed as it would have enough complexity that it is not easily guessed or brute-forced. However, a server method is in place to generate a new string if necessary.

The sharing modal also allows the customer to be allow or disallow guests to download individual photos from the public gallery. The download option is always available on private galleries and admin galleries.
